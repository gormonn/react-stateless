# react-stateless
Merging tool for nested stateless components

When creating ui or stateless components, you may encounter the problem of nesting stateless components.

For example, you could create a generic Toggle component.

Which, depending on the props passed to, can be modified into: checkbox, radiobox, switch and so on.

And the current counteraction to the problem is the creation of 3 versions of the component. Which can be annoying.

The goal of this project is to find out how to solve the problem of nested components, with a minimum amount of boilerplate.
